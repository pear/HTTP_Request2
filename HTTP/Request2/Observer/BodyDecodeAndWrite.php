/**
 * This Observer is written in compliment to pear's HTTP_Request2 in order to
 * avoid reading the whole response body in memory. Instead it writes the body
 * to a stream. If the body is transferred with content-encoding set to
 * "deflate" or "gzip" it is decoded on the fly.
 *
 * The constructor accepts an already opened (for write) stream (file_descriptor).
 * If the response is deflate/gzip encoded a "zlib.inflate" filter is applied
 * to the stream. When the body has been read from the request and written to
 * the stream ("receivedBody" event) the filter is removed from the stream.
 *
 * The "zlib.inflate" filter works fine with pure "deflate" encoding. It does
 * not understand the "deflate+zlib" and "gzip" headers though, so they have to
 * be removed prior to being passed to the stream. This is done in the "update"
 * method.
 *
 * It is also possible to limit the size of written extracted bytes by passing
 * "max_bytes" to the constructor. This is important because e.g. 1GB of
 * zeroes take about a MB when compressed.
 *
 * Exceptions are being thrown if data could not be written to the stream or
 * the written bytes have already exceeded the requested maximum. If the "gzip"
 * header is malformed or could not be parsed an exception will be thrown too.
 *
 * Example usage follows:
 *
 * <code>
